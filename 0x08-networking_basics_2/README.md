# 0x08. Networking Basics #1

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Networking Basics #1" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on understanding network devices, IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.

## Project Overview

The "Networking Basics #1" project aims to deepen the understanding of networking by exploring network devices, IP addressing, subnetting, and routing. These concepts are fundamental in designing and managing computer networks. The project involves various tasks that help students grasp the concepts and apply them practically.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following tasks:

- **0-binary_to_decimal**: This file explains how to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers.
- **1-decimal_to_binary**: This file explains how to convert decimal numbers to binary numbers.
- **2-change_ip**: This file describes how to change an IP address while explaining network masks.
- **3-IP_address**: This file answers a series of questions related to IP addresses, subnets, and network devices.
- **4-subnetting**: This file explains the concepts of IP subnetting and CIDR notation.
- **5-subnetting_on_2_hosts**: This file demonstrates how to subnet and assign IP addresses for two hosts in different subnets.
- **6-0-255**: This file provides answers to questions about IP addresses ranging from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

## Usage

To access the content for each task, simply open the respective file using a text editor.
