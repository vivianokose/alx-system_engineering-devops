# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Networking Basics #0" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on understanding the basics of networking, including IP addresses, OSI model, and TCP/UDP protocols.

## Project Overview

The "Networking Basics #0" project aims to develop a foundational understanding of networking concepts. It covers essential topics such as IP addresses, the OSI model, and TCP/UDP protocols. The project involves various tasks that help students grasp the fundamental principles of networking.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following tasks:

- **0-OSI_model**: This file contains the OSI model concepts from Layer 1 to Layer 7.
- **1-types_of_network**: This file explains the different types of networks, including LAN, WAN, MAN, and WLAN.
- **2-MAC_and_IP_address**: This file describes MAC and IP addresses, their format, and their role in networking.
- **3-UDP_and_TCP**: This file provides an overview of the UDP and TCP protocols, including their characteristics and use cases.
- **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports**: This file lists some common TCP and UDP ports and their associated services.

## Usage

To access the content of each task, simply open the respective file using a text editor.
