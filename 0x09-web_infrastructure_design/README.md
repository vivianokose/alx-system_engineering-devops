# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

This repository contains documentation and resources related to the "Web infrastructure design" project from Holberton School's systems engineering curriculum. The goal is to understand how to design, implement and manage robust and scalable web applications and services.

## Project overview

This project aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to design and deploy production-ready web applications and services. Key topics covered include:

- Load balancers 
- Caching
- CDNs
- Authentication
- Databases
- Monitoring
- High availability
- Serverless architectures
- Containers
- Infrastructure as code
- Security best practices

Students will learn how to horizontally scale applications, distribute load, and make systems fault-tolerant using tools and patterns adopted by industry leaders. The focus is on building reliable, performant and secure infrastructure.

## Documentation

The project is organized into the following topics:

- **0-simple_web_stack**: Illustrates a basic web stack with load balancer, application and database servers.
- **1-distributed_web_infrastructure**: Describes strategies for distributing applications across multiple server zones.
- **2-secured_and_monitorized_web_infrastructure**: Best practices for securing and monitoring infrastructure components.  
- **3-scale_up**: Techniques for scaling applications vertically by increasing resources.

## Usage

Each topic contains documentation in Markdown format. Review the files in this repository to learn about web infrastructure design principles and best practices. 

Additional resources are also provided to deepen understanding of key concepts.
