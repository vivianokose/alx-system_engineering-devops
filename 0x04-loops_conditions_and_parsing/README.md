# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Loops, Conditions, and Parsing" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on understanding and implementing loops, conditions, and parsing techniques in the Bash scripting language.

## Project Overview

The "Loops, Conditions, and Parsing" project aims to develop a deep understanding of loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash. These concepts are essential for writing efficient and effective scripts. The project involves implementing various scripts that showcase the usage of loops, conditional statements, and different parsing techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **0-RSA_public_key.pub**: This file contains an RSA public key used in one of the scripts.
- **1-for_holberton_school**: This script prints "Holberton School" 10 times using a `for` loop.
- **2-while_holberton_school**: This script prints "Holberton School" 10 times using a `while` loop.
- **3-until_holberton_school**: This script prints "Holberton School" 10 times using an `until` loop.
- **4-if_9_say_hi**: This script prints "Hi" if the number 9 is included in the provided list.
- **5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance**: This script replaces the numbers 4 and 8 with the string "bad luck" in a given list.
- **6-superstitious_numbers**: This script prints numbers from 1 to 20 while skipping 4, 9, and 17.
- **7-clock**: This script displays the time in a 12-hour format.
- **100-read_and_cut**: This script reads a file and extracts the 11th field from each line.
- **101-tell_the_story_of_passwd**: This script parses the `/etc/passwd` file and generates a story based on its contents.
- **102-lets_parse_apache_logs**: This script parses an Apache log file and displays statistics.

## Usage

To use the scripts provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/loops-conditions-parsing.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd loops-conditions-parsing`
3. Execute the desired script using the Bash interpreter. For example: `bash 1-for_holberton_school`

Read the script comments and output to understand their functionality.

## Testing

Some of the scripts in this project have test cases to verify their functionality. Run the test cases using the following command:

```bash
bash tests/test_script.sh
```

Ensure you are in the project's root directory when executing the command.
