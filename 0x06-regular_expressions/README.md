# 0x06. Regular Expression

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Regular Expression" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on understanding and working with regular expressions to match and manipulate text patterns.

## Project Overview

The "Regular Expression" project aims to develop a deep understanding of regular expressions and their usage. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation in text. This project involves implementing various programs that utilize regular expressions to solve different problems.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **0-simply_match_holberton**: This script uses a regular expression to match the pattern "Holberton" in a provided string.
- **1-repetition_token_0**: This script uses a regular expression with a repetition token to match a specific pattern in a string.
- **2-repetition_token_1**: This script uses a regular expression with a repetition token to match a specific pattern in a string.
- **3-repetition_token_2**: This script uses a regular expression with a repetition token to match a specific pattern in a string.
- **4-repetition_token_3**: This script uses a regular expression with a repetition token to match a specific pattern in a string.
- **5-beginning_and_end**: This script uses a regular expression to match a pattern only at the beginning and end of a string.
- **6-phone_number**: This script uses a regular expression to match a specific phone number pattern.
- **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING**: This script uses a regular expression to match uppercase words in a provided string.
- **100-textme**: This script extracts specific information from a log file using regular expressions.
- **101-passed_linkedin_regex_challenge**: This file contains the link to a LinkedIn regular expression puzzle challenge.

## Usage

To use the scripts provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/regular-expression.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd regular-expression`
3. Execute the desired script using the Bash interpreter. For example: `bash 0-simply_match_holberton`

Read the script comments and output to understand its functionality.

## Testing

Some of the scripts in this project have test cases to verify their functionality. Run the test cases using the following command:

```bash
bash tests/test_script.sh
```

Ensure you are in the project's root directory when executing the command.
